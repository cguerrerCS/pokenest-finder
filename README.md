# PokeNest (Beta Version)

A Pokemon Go companion app designed to help trainers locate nearby Pokemon Nests (hotspots where a particular species of Pokemon spawns frequently). Trainers can post their findings to PokeNest by geotagging a discovered hotspot; other trainers can then view the marked locations as well as leave feedback concerning said location. Plans for the future include making the app self sustainable to the point that it can handle nest migrations (species shifts that happen on a monthly basis).
